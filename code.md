❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` relies on global variables `a` and `b` without explicitly declaring or passing them as arguments.
This makes the function unpredictable and prone to errors, as its behavior depends on the values of `a` and `b` in the
global scope.
* ❌ Lack of input validation or error handling. If `a` or `b` are not numbers, the function might return unexpected
results or throw an error.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return 'Error: Both arguments must be numbers.';
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function more predictable and reusable.
* ✔ Includes input validation to ensure that both arguments are numbers, and returns an error message if not.
* ✔ Clearer and more explicit, improving readability and maintainability.
